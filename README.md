it was planned to wait for a more advanced adaptation before the fork creation

currently for 1.1 only  
if you don't have a valid cd-key, you can join the server using the `sv_cracked` cvar set to `1`

the initial objective of this fork is to make the 1.5 servers able to activate the 1.1 player movements, using a maintained base (zk_libcod)

but ideally this fork would be able to replace codextended, because one of the reasons is that we (cod1 server owners) could continue working with a base (libcod1) which can receive support by the CoD2 hooking community (which is more active than the CoD1 one), more easily than using codextended
