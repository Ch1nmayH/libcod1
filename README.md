Work in progress, not ready for a safe and reliable production

Currently for 1.1 patch only  
If you don't have a valid cd-key, you can join the server using the `sv_cracked` cvar set to `1`

One of the objectives of this fork is to have a modern alternative to CoDExtended, so that CoD1 server owners can continue working with an up-to-date base, and can more easily receive support from the CoD2 hooking community.
