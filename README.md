it was planned to wait for a more advanced port before the fork creation

currently the project can build, is for 1.1 only, and if you don't have a valid cd-key, you can join the server using the `sv_cracked` cvar set to `1`

the initial objective of this fork is to make the 1.5 servers able to activate the 1.1 player movements, using a maintained base  
but ideally this fork would be able to replace codextended, so that we (cod1 server owners) could continue working with a base which is supported by the CoD2 hooking community, which is more active than the CoD1 one
